<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

GaiaUnlimited aims at determining the Gaia survey selection function and providing corresponding data and tools. The GaiaUnlimited project was started at the [2019 Santa Barbara Gaia Sprint](http://gaia.lol/2019SB.html), hosted by the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
